# Why Are Joins Slow?

## Shuffled Join

The rows with the same key needs to be on the same partition and on the same executor so Spark could execute the join in memory. Hence, If DFs or RDDs don't have a known partitioner, a **Shuffle** is needed

**An Optimized Shuffled Join**

- Data Transfer Overhead.
- Potential OOMs.
- Limited Parallelism (due to shuffle).

## Co-Partitioned RDDs

- Have the same partitioner.
- May be on different executors.
- will (in general) be joined with network traffic (although much less than without the partitioning information).

## Co-Located RDDs

- Have the same partitioner.
- Reside in the same physical location in memory (on the same executor).
- Can be Joined without any network transfer.

### Shuffling, colocation & copartitioning apply to RDDs and DFs.
