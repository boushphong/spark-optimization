## Recommendations
1) Only cache what's being reused a lot
- Don't cache too much or you risk the executors running out of memory (OOM Error)
- The **LRU(least-recently-used)** data will be evicted

2) If data fits in memory, use MEMORY_ONLY (default)
- Most CPU efficient

3) If data is larger use MEMORY_ONLY_SER
- More CPU intensive, but still faster than anything else

4) Use disk caching only for really expensive computations
- Simple filters take just as much (or even less) to recompute than reread from disk
