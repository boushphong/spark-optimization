1. Coalesce
- Coalesce is a narrow dependency (one input (parent) partition influences a single output (child) partition)
- Coalesce will still move some data. However, it is **not a full shuffle**, and always faster than a suffle from repartitioning.

2. Repartition
- Repartition is a narrow dependency (one input (parent) partition influences more than one output partitions)
- Repartition will evenly distribute the data and will always involve in a **full shuffle**.
